# Cylinder benchmark case

This is a simple benchmark case for the immersed boundary method. The case is a
cylinder in a channel with a flow. The cylinder is fixed and the flow is driven
by a pressure gradient. The cylinder is added by two methods. The first method
is to add the cylinder as a conforming mesh with a wall boundary condition. The
second method is to add the cylinder as a Brinkman type immersed boundary
condition.

The domain is a channel with a length of 4 and a height of 1. The cylinder has
a diameter of 0.5 and is located at the center of the channel.
