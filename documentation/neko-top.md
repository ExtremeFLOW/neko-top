The Neko-TOP library is an extension of the Neko library, which is a high-order
spectral element solver. The Neko-TOP library is designed to solve topology
optimization problems using an immersed boundary method. The library is written
in Fortran and is designed to be used in combination with the Neko library.

This project is a direct extension of [Neko](https://neko.cfd), so please also
observe the documentation for Neko for specific details on case files and the
user interface.
